C335 Final Project Report

Yitian Zhang

For the final project, my job is to write the core function for the game 
and midify some driver files which are used in our final project. I implement level attribute to the snake
 structue, which can speed up the game depends on the length of the snake. I know the snake is not a
 creative game but I think the main point of this final project is to put what we learned together and
 make a program. Actually, this whole project is a big challenge for me because I'm really not good at C.
 The biggest challenge for me is making the snake move automatically without using nunchuk. This problem 
takes me a look of times. but, finally, I found out a way out. I seperated nunchuk controlling functions 
from snake moving function and used previous variable to store the previous nunchuk key which input by 
user.

If I can restart the project from scratch, I will build a more complicated game and I will try to use gyro 
as a controller. Also, I will use a better lcd and everything else to make our game become more user-friendly.
